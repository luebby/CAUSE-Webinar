To take the best action or causal conclusion based on multivariate (observational) data analysis:

- Data is not just there - it has a generating process and we should care about this.

- Confounding and bias can be serious issues for causal inference.

- Adjusting or not adjusting. Both  can be bad ideas for causal inference.

- Quantitative model checks may not reveal which model is best for causal inference.

- Structural causal models and directed acyclic graphs can help to build a bridge between reality, theory and data.

## Causal effect, potential outcomes and counterfactuals

Let $X_i$ be $1$ if someone attends this workshop and else $0$. Also let $Y_i$ be the somehow operationalized knowledge about causal inference:

- $Y_i^{|X_i=1}$: knowledge if attending (treatment group).

- $Y_i^{|X_i=0}$ knowledge if not attending (control group).

Be precise: What is the causal effect of attending?

--

E.g. Neyman–Rubin causal model:

$$\Delta_i = Y_i^{|X_i=1} -  Y_i^{|X_i=0}$$ 


But: For each $i$ we (usually) can only observe one of the **potential outcomes**. For *you* being here we can only observe $y_i^{|x_i=1}$. For  *you* $y_i^{|x_i=0}$ is the unobserved **counterfactual** outcome.

Also: There may be **confounding** covariates which may effect $X$ and $Y$ like e.g. $C$: cleverness. Therefore a naive analysis of e.g. $\bar{\delta}$ can be **biased**.

In randomized controlled trials allocation of $i$ to either $x_i$ being $0$ or $1$ is randomized. With this one hopes to balance the distribution of the covariates between treatment and control group.

## Saratoga Houses

Data on houses in Saratoga County, New York, USA in 2006. Analysis in `R`:

library(mosaic); data(SaratogaHouses)
# Scatterplot
gf_point(price ~ bedrooms, data = SaratogaHouses) %>%

## Modelling value of my 2-bedroom house

Linear Model: ${\text{price}}_i = {\beta}_0 + {\beta}_{\text{bedrooms}} \times \text{bedrooms}_i + \epsilon_i$:

```{r}
# Linear Regression
my.model <- lm(price ~ bedrooms, data = SaratogaHouses); my.model 
```

So: $\hat{\beta}_{\text{bedrooms}}=`r round(coef(my.model)[2],2)`$

--

```{r}
# My house: 2 bedrooms; Point prediction
My.House <- data.frame(bedrooms = 2); predict(my.model, newdata = My.House)
```

$$\widehat{\text{price}}^{|\text{bedrooms}=2} \approx `r round(predict(my.model, newdata = My.House))`$$


---

## Turn data into money

```{r, echo= FALSE , out.width = "15%", fig.align="center"}

--

```{r}
# My rebuilt house: now 4 bedrooms
My.NewHouse <- data.frame(bedrooms = 4)
# My money (?)
predict(my.model, newdata = My.NewHouse) - predict(my.model, newdata = My.House)
```

So:

$$\widehat{\text{price}}^{|\text{bedrooms}=4} - \widehat{\text{price}}^{|\text{bedrooms}=2} = (4-2) \times \hat{\beta}_{\text{bedrooms}}=`r 2*round(coef(my.model)[2],2)`$$

---

## Really?

Make three bedrooms out of one and the value of my house goes up by $\approx 100.000$ Dollar?

## Causal Model

The number of bedrooms depends on the house size - as well as the price (**confounding**/ **lurking** variable):

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "40%", fig.align="center"}
DAG_Immo
```


---

## Omitted-variable bias

Ok, let's **adjust** for `livingArea`:

```{r}
my.adj.model <- lm(price ~ bedrooms + livingArea, data = SaratogaHouses); my.adj.model
```

Now: $\hat{\beta}_{\text{bedrooms}}=`r round(coef(my.adj.model)[2],2)`$ (instead of $\hat{\beta}_{\text{bedrooms}}=`r round(coef(my.model)[2],2)`$ unadjusted for ` livingArea`). So: price falls instead of rises if I split a bedroom. (**Simpson's Paradox**)

## Levels of causal inference


[Pearl (2019)](https://doi.org/10.1145/3241036) establishes a three-level hierarchy:

- **Association**: $P(y|x)$: Seeing: *what is?*, i.e., the probability of $Y=y$ given that we observe $X=x$.

- **Intervention**: $P(y|do(x))$: Manipulation: *what if?*, i.e., the probability of $Y=y$ given that we intervene and set the value of $X$ to $x$.

- **Counterfactuals**: $P(y_x|x',y')$: Imagining: *what if I had acted differently?*, i.e., the probability of $Y=y$ if $X$ had been $x$ given that we actually observed $x',y'$.

--

[Witmer (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1080/00029890.2020.1671757):

> The  scientific  community  would  benefit  greatly  from  a  better  understanding of causal inference - and "better" is quite a low bar, given how little the tools of causal reasoning have been used over the years. But statisticians have stood in the way, insisting that cause-and-effect conclusions can only be drawn from randomized experiments and delighting in telling stories about confounded effects that arise when analyzing observational data, all while repeating the  mantra  that correlation is  not  causation. In so doing, we statisticians congratulate ourselves too much, while turning students away from asking and answering questions of genuine interest. At the same time, we hamper the advancement of scientific and societal progress.

## One page of theory

- $X \rightarrow Y: \quad Y=f(X, U_Y)$ with some function $f(\cdot)$ and some exogenous $U$. 

- The value of $Y$ depends on $X$ - but the value of $X$ **not** on $Y$. 

- Causally there is no inverse function $f^{-1}(\cdot)$. My weight growths with my height but unfortunately my height not with my weight.

<br>



| Path                       | $X \rightarrow C \rightarrow Y$ | $X \leftarrow C \rightarrow Y$ | $X \rightarrow C \leftarrow Y$ 
| ---------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Name                       | Chain                           | Fork                           | Collider         
| Association $X$ to $Y$     | Causal                          | Non-causal                     | None                       
| Adjusting $C$              | Blocks causal path              | Blocks non-causal path         | Opens non-causal path

<br>

**Idea**: To estimate the change in $y$ if $x$ is changed: Block non-causal paths, open causal paths and don't open a biasing path.

  - Knowing sunshine I don't learn more about ice cream by sunscreen. Conditionally on sunshine they are independent. Formally: $X{\perp\!\!\!\perp}Y|C$

  - Knowing that it is weekend I learn nothing about whether it is holiday or not: Unconditionally, i.e. marginal, they are independent. Formally: $X{\perp\!\!\!\perp}Y$
  
  - Knowing that I can sleep late and that it is not weekend I learn that it must be holiday: Conditionally on sleep they are not independent. Formally: $X \not\!\perp\!\!\!\perp Y|C$
  

---

## More on Chains, forks and colliders and graphs

Role of $C$:

- $X \rightarrow C \rightarrow Y$: $C$ is a mediator between $X$ and $Y$.

- $X \leftarrow C \rightarrow Y$: $C$ is a common cause of $X$ and $Y$.

- $X \rightarrow C \leftarrow Y$ : $C$ is a common effect of $X$ and $Y$.

<br>

Elements of a graph:

- All variables with an arrow into $Z$ are called parents of $Z$.

- All variables with an arrow from $Z$ are called children of $Z$.

- No arrow between two variables indicate that there is no direct association between them.

## Data generating process

.pull-left[
$$ X = U_X, \quad U_X \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\,1),$$
$$Y = X +  U_Y, \quad U_Y \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\,1),$$
$$Z = Y + U_Z, \quad U_Z \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\,0.1).$$
where $\mathcal{N}(\mu,\,\sigma)$ stands for normal distribution with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$.
]

.pull-right[
In `R`:

```{r}
set.seed(1896)
x <- rnorm(100, mean = 0, sd = 1)
y <- x + rnorm(100, mean = 0, sd = 1)
z <- y + rnorm(100, mean = 0, sd = 0.1)
```

```{r, include=FALSE}
set.seed(1896)
x <- rnorm(100)
y <- x + rnorm(100)
z <- y + rnorm(100, sd = 0.1)
Chain <- data.frame(x=x, y=y, z=z)
```
]

So **causally**: 

<br>

$$X \rightarrow Y \rightarrow Z$$

**Note**: The outcome $Y$ is in the middle of the chain - not at the end.

## Dating

**Assume** you date someone because he is good looking or because he is kind. Moreover assume that looking and kindness are independent.


```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "40%", fig.align="center"}
DAG_Date
```


---

## Data generating process

$$X = U_X, \quad U_X \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\,1),$$
$$Y = U_Y, \quad U_Y \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\,1),$$
$$\widetilde{C} =\begin{cases} 1 & ,\, \text{if } \{ X > 1 \,\vee\, Y > 1\} \\ 0 & ,\, \text{else } \end{cases},$$
$$C = (1-U_C) \cdot \widetilde{C} + U_C \cdot (1- \widetilde{C}), \quad U_C \sim \mathcal{B}(0.05).$$
where $\mathcal{B}(\pi)$ stands for the Bernoulli distribution.

In `R`:

```{r}
set.seed(1896)

kind<- rnorm(1000)
look <- rnorm(1000)
dating <- ((kind > 1) | (look > 1)) 
luck <- rbinom(1000, size = 1, prob = 0.05)
dating <- (1 - luck) * dating + luck * (1 - dating)
```

```{r, include=FALSE}
Date <- data.frame(kind, look, dating=(dating==1))
```


---

## Modelling: Marginal

Modelling of `kind` by `look`:

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "50%", fig.asp = 0.8, fig.align="center"}
ggformula::gf_point(kind~look, data = Date) %>%
  gf_lm() + ggthemes::scale_color_colorblind()
```


---

## Modelling: Conditional

Modelling of `kind` by `look`, adjusted for `dating`:

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "50%", fig.asp = 0.8, fig.align="center"}
ggformula::gf_point(kind~look, color=~dating, data = Date) %>%
  gf_lm() + ggthemes::scale_color_colorblind()
```

- Adjusted for the common effect (dating) there is an association between the independent causes good looking and kindness (**Berkson's Paradox**).




---

## Selection/ Collider Bias

Modelling of `kind` by `look`, selected by `dating`:

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "50%", fig.asp = 0.8, fig.align="center"}
Dated <- Date %>% filter(dating==TRUE)
ggformula::gf_point(kind~look, data = Dated) %>%
  gf_lm() + ggthemes::scale_color_colorblind()
```

- There is also an association between the independent causes good looking and kindness if your data consists only of those who you dated.

To take the best action or causal conclusion based on multivariate (observational) data analysis:

- Data is not just there - it has a generating process and we should care about this.

- Confounding and bias can be serious issues for causal inference.

- Adjusting or not adjusting. Both  can be bad ideas for causal inference.

- Quantitative model checks may not reveal which model is best for causal inference.

- Structural causal models and directed acyclic graphs can help to build a bridge between reality, theory and data.
